"In 2018, crimes committed in retribution for the work of journalist were brought to the forefront of global discussion by the highly publicized killing of Saudi Arabian dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a contributor to the Washington Post. Journalism is widely regarded as a critical component of a well-functioning democracy, because it provides accountability for a country's leaders. Violence against journalists as a factor that increases self-censorship and thus impair journalist ability to hold people in power accountable. In addition to the negative effect of press censorship on the wellbeing of democracies, this pointed violence shows an increase in repression of civil rights often occurs in the 2 years following the killing of a journalist.",
